Stefan founded the Marine Robotics Group within the Australian Centre for (Field) Robotics twenty years ago,
bringing AUVs into Australia for the use of benthic ecologists around the country. He has led the group through
that time - including the development of new systems designed for seafloor visual survey, numerous field
campaigns and has an interest and involvement in almost anything to do with AUV research - from localisation,
control and perception via machine learning techniques.
