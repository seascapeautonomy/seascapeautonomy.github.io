# Defence Export Control Requirements

## 1.	Condition of Supply
You acknowledge that our provision of the Goods and/or Services is strictly conditional upon your ongoing compliance with these Defence Export Control Requirements.

## 2.	Compliance with Export Control Laws
Both Parties must at all times comply with all applicable Export Control Laws. These laws include the Defence and Strategic Goods List (DSGL), which identifies items that cannot be exported from Australia unless an appropriate licence or authorisation has been granted by the Minister or a duly authorised person, and that approval is produced to Customs prior to export (Licence). Certain Goods and/or Services we supply may be captured under the DSGL.

## 3.	Regulatory Cooperation and Exclusion of Liability
In accordance with Export Control Laws, we are required to cooperate with the Department of Defence Australia to identify, monitor, report, and prevent transactions that may contravene those laws. We must also ensure that any required Licence is obtained for Goods supplied to overseas recipients.

We exclude any Liability arising from your failure to comply with Export Control Laws, as well as any Liability arising from actions we take to meet our legal obligations under those laws.
## 4.	Indemnity
To the fullest extent permitted by law (and subject to your rights under applicable Consumer Law), you indemnify us against all Liability suffered or incurred by us arising out of, or in connection with, any breach by you of Export Control Laws or these Defence Export Control Requirements.

## 5.	Record-Keeping
You must maintain accurate financial and related records in connection with the Agreement and the supply of the Goods and/or Services, as required under Export Control Laws (Records).

## 6.	Provision of Records
Upon reasonable request, you must provide us (or, where applicable, the Department of Defence Australia) with copies of any Records in the manner and timeframe requested, including where necessary to ensure compliance with any Licence referred to in clause 2.

## 7.	Audit Rights
If you do not comply with clause 6, you grant us (and, where applicable, the Department of Defence Australia) the right to inspect your Records to the extent reasonably required to verify your compliance with Export Control Laws (Audit).

## 8.	Consequences of Non-Compliance
If an Audit reveals that you have failed to comply with Export Control Laws, or are at risk of non-compliance, we may immediately terminate the Agreement (including any Work Order). You agree to reimburse our reasonable termination costs in such circumstances.

## 9.	Regulatory Approval and Timing
You acknowledge that we have no control over how the Department of Defence Australia interprets or applies Export Control Laws.

Where the Agreement specifies a timeframe for supply of the Goods and/or Services, we will use reasonable efforts to meet that timeframe. However, you acknowledge that any stated timeframe is indicative only and subject to prior approval by the Department of Defence Australia and the granting of any required Licence. These matters are outside our control.

The timeframe for supply may:

a. be facilitated by your full compliance with Export Control Law requirements;

b. depend on your cooperation with us and the Department of Defence Australia;

c. vary according to the quantity or scope of Goods and/or Services requested; and

d. be influenced by a risk assessment undertaken by the Department of Defence Australia, taking into account factors such as your corporate background, country risk profile, geopolitical considerations, and the nature of the Goods and/or Services involved.
