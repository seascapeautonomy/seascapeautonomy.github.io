Our Goods include embedded Firmware as described on the applicable product webpage.
 
## 2. Licence Grant

2.2 No Transfer

You must not assign, sublicense, or otherwise transfer the Licence (in whole or in part) to any other person without our prior written consent.

3.2 Account Security
Where applicable to the Downloadable Software, you and your Personnel must:

-	maintain the confidentiality and security of usernames and passwords; and
-	promptly notify us if you become aware of, or suspect, any unauthorised access to the Firmware or Downloadable Software.

3.3 Prohibited Conduct

You must not, and must ensure that your Personnel do not:
1.	disrupt or interfere with the operation or availability of the Firmware or Downloadable Software, or interfere with another user’s access or use;
2.	bypass authentication measures or security controls, or use the software in a manner that is unlawful, infringes third-party rights (including intellectual property or privacy rights), or may result in civil or criminal liability;
3.	upload or introduce viruses, malware, or other harmful code;
4.	use unauthorised, altered, or modified versions of the software, including for the purpose of developing competing products or obtaining unauthorised access;
5.	attempt to access data, servers, or accounts without express authorisation;

7.	attempt to circumvent security protections of our systems or those of any third party;

9.	provide access to any person not authorised under the Licence; or
10.	export, share, or otherwise deal with the software in breach of applicable Export Control Laws.
 
## 4. SaaS-Based Downloadable Software Availability
For any Downloadable Software provided on a SaaS basis, we do not warrant uninterrupted or continuous availability. The service may be unavailable from time to time, including due to scheduled maintenance, urgent repairs, or circumstances beyond our control.
 
## 5. Third-Party Dependencies
The Firmware and Downloadable Software may interface with or depend upon products or services supplied by third parties.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not responsible for outages, delays, or performance issues caused wholly or partly by third-party providers.

If you engage third-party products or services to integrate or operate with the Firmware or Downloadable Software, those third parties act independently of us. You are responsible for those third-party goods and services unless otherwise agreed in the applicable Work Order.
 
## 6. Intellectual Property
You receive no ownership or intellectual property rights in the Firmware or Downloadable Software other than the Licence expressly granted under these Software Licence Terms.

We may suspend or terminate the Licence if you breach these Software Licence Terms or any provision of the Agreement.

Any feedback, suggestions, or recommendations you provide regarding the Firmware or Downloadable Software may be used by us for any purpose, including product development and feature enhancements, without compensation or obligation to you.
 
## 7. Updates and Enhancements
From time to time, we may release updates, upgrades, patches, or fixes to the Firmware or Downloadable Software (Upgrades).

7.1 Free Upgrade Period

We will provide access to Upgrades at no additional charge for 12 months from the date you purchased the relevant Goods (Free Upgrade Period).

7.2 Installation

Upgrades must be manually downloaded from our website. Unless expressly agreed in a Work Order (for example, under onsite or offsite Help Desk Support), we are not responsible for installation or support relating to installation.

You must take all reasonable steps to ensure Upgrades are installed promptly and correctly.

During the Free Upgrade Period, no access key will be required to obtain Upgrades.

7.3 Effect of Upgrades

Generally, Upgrades are not expected to materially and adversely impact your use of the Goods. By way of illustration, a material adverse impact would include a change that substantially reduces core functionality relied upon in normal operation.
 
## 8. Software as a “Moving Target”
You acknowledge that the Firmware and Downloadable Software (once installed) are not cloud-based and reflect the version current at the time of the most recent update or fix. Accordingly, compliance with your obligations regarding updates is important.

You also acknowledge that achieving a particular result at one time does not guarantee the same result in the future, especially following an update or modification. We make no representations that identical outcomes will always be achieved.

The software covered by our Warranty Against Defects is identified in your Work Order and available at:
