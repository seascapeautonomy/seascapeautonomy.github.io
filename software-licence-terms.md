## Availability of SAAS based Downloadable Software
In respect of any of the Downloadable Software that is SaaS based, we make no guarantees that the Downloadable Software will be available 100% of the time. The Downloadable Software may be disrupted during certain periods, including, for example, as a result of scheduled or emergency maintenance.

## Third-Party Reliance
The Firmware and Downloadable Software may interact with, or be reliant on, products or services provided by third-parties. To the maximum extent permitted by Law, we are not liable for disruptions or downtime caused or contributed to by these third-parties. 

Where you engage third parties to operate alongside the Firmware and Downloadable Software (for example, any third-party software systems you wish to integrate with the Firmware and Downloadable Software), those third-parties are independent of us and you are responsible for the goods or services they provide, unless we expressly agree otherwise in the applicable Work Order.

## Moving Target

You also agree and acknowledge that while you may have achieved a certain outcome through using our Firmware and Downloadable Software on one day or at a particular time, this does not mean (and we make no promises or representations in relation to), you being able to obtain the same result again (particularly after an update or fix).
