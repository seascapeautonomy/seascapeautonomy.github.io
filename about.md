# Seascape Autonomy

![Seascape Autonomy Logo](/assets/images/logo_iris_transparent_centre.png)

Founded to bring seafloor imaging from the research lab to the world at large. With a primary
focus on data collection for environmental reporting we're connected into [Squidle.org](https://squidle.org)
and have been the team behind the IMOS AUVs Sirius and Nimbus.
