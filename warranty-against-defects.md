# Warranty Against Defects
This Warranty Against Defects is issued under and forms part of the supply agreement between **Seascape Autonomy Pty Ltd (ACN 676 897 813)** (we, us, our) and the customer identified in the applicable Work Order (you). Together, we are the Parties.

This Warranty applies only to the Goods and Services specified in the relevant Work Order.

For clarity:
-	If the Work Order states that this Warranty Against Defects applies to the Goods and Services, the benefits provided under this Warranty are in addition to any rights or remedies available to you under the Australian Consumer Law or any other applicable legislation (Consumer Law Rights).
-	If the Work Order provides for an Extended Warranty in relation to certain Goods or Services, the Extended Warranty period specified in the Work Order replaces the standard Warranty Period set out in this document for those items. All other terms of this Warranty continue to apply to the Extended Warranty.

Our Goods and Services come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law. In summary:
-	For major failures with services, you may cancel the service contract and obtain a refund for the unused portion, or receive compensation for any reduction in value.
-	For major failures with goods, you may choose a refund or replacement.
-	For non-major failures, you are entitled to have the issue rectified within a reasonable time. If this does not occur, you may obtain a refund for goods, cancel the service contract, and receive a refund for any unused portion.
-	You may also recover compensation for any reasonably foreseeable loss or damage resulting from the failure.
 
## 1. Warranty Coverage

1.3 Application During Warranty Period

If the Goods or Services become defective during the Warranty Period, and subject to the terms of this Warranty, we will provide the applicable remedy described above. Your Consumer Law Rights may continue beyond the Warranty Period.

3.2 Additional Work

If you request additional work or services beyond what is required to remedy a defect covered by this Warranty, we may charge additional fees. We will notify you of those charges before commencing such work. We are not obliged to carry out additional requested services.

3.3 Replacement Parts

Any replacement of parts under this Warranty does not extend or renew the original Warranty Period.
 
## 4. General Terms
4.1 Order of Precedence

If there is any inconsistency between this Warranty and the Terms, this Warranty prevails. If there is any inconsistency between this Warranty and a Work Order, the Work Order prevails.

4.2 Governing Law and Jurisdiction

This Warranty is governed by the laws of New South Wales, Australia, and is enforceable within Australia.

If Goods or Services are purchased outside Australia, then to the maximum extent permitted by law, statutory warranties under the Australian Consumer Law will not apply, but you may rely on this Warranty where applicable.

4.3 No Third-Party Benefit

This Warranty is provided solely for your benefit as the original purchaser of the Goods and Services. No other person may rely upon or enforce this Warranty.

4.4 No Assignment

You may not assign or transfer this Warranty or its benefits to any other person. However, where our authorised reseller supplies the Goods or Services, the benefit of this Warranty is intended to extend to the end user, as the reseller acts as our distributor.

4.5 Severability

If any provision of this Warranty is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, it will be read down to the extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable. If that is not possible, the provision will be severed without affecting the remainder of this Warranty or the Agreement.

4.6 Definitions

Unless otherwise defined in this document, capitalised terms have the meanings given in the applicable Work Order and/or our Terms available at:
