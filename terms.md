If the Parties do not resolve the Dispute within 20 Business Days of the date the Dispute Notice was served (or such further period as agreed in writing by the Parties), either Party may:

  a.	where you are resident or incorporated in Australia, refer the matter to mediation, administered by the Australian Disputes Centre, to be conducted in Sydney, New South Wales, in accordance with the Australian Disputes Centre Guidelines for Commercial Mediation.

  b.	where you are not resident or incorporated in Australia, refer the matter to arbitration administered by the Australian Centre for International Commercial Arbitration, with such arbitration to be conducted in Sydney, New South Wales, before one arbitrator, in English and in accordance with the ACICA Arbitration Rules.

Nothing in this clause will operate to prevent a Party from seeking urgent injunctive or equitable relief from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.

11.5 Electronic Execution: Our Agreement may be executed using an Electronic Signature. The Parties acknowledge and agree that if a Party executes our Agreement using an Electronic Signature, then the Party is taken to have entered into our Agreement in electronic form and the Electronic Signature is deemed to be an original execution of the Agreement by the Party. “Electronic Signature” means an electronic method of signing that identifies the person and indicates their intention to sign our Agreement, which may include software programs such as DocuSign.

11.6 Force Majeure: Neither Party will be liable for any delay or failure to perform their respective obligations under our Agreement if such delay or failure is caused or contributed to by a Force Majeure Event, provided that the Party seeking to rely on the benefit of this clause:

  a.	as soon as reasonably practical, notifies the other Party in writing details of the Force Majeure Event, and the extent to which it is unable to perform its obligations; and

  b.	uses reasonable endeavours to minimise the duration and adverse consequences of the Force Majeure Event.

Where the Force Majeure Event prevents a Party from performing a material obligation under our Agreement for a period in excess of 60 days, then the other Party may by notice terminate our Agreement, which will be effective immediately, unless otherwise stated in the notice. This clause will not apply to a Party’s obligation to pay any amount that is due and payable to the other Party under our Agreement.

11.7 Governing Law: Our Agreement is governed by the laws of New South Wales.  Each Party irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts operating in New South Wales and any courts entitled to hear appeals from those courts and waives any right to object to proceedings being brought in those courts.  The Parties agree that the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the Sale of International Goods is excluded from application to this Agreement.

11.8 Notices: Any notice given under our Agreement must be in writing addressed to the addresses set out in our Agreement, or the relevant address last notified by the recipient to the Parties in accordance with this clause. Any notice may be sent by standard post or email, and will be deemed to have been served on the expiry of 48 hours in the case of post, or at the time of transmission in the case of transmission by email.

11.9 Relationship of Parties: Our Agreement is not intended to create a partnership, joint venture, employment or agency relationship between the Parties.

11.10 Subcontracting: We may subcontract the supply of any part of our Goods and Services without your prior written consent.  We agree that any subcontracting does not discharge us from any liability under our Agreement and that we are liable for the acts and omissions of our subcontractor.

11.11 Interpretation: In the event of any inconsistency between our Agreement, a document referred to in it and the terms of any applicable Work Order the order of priority of interpretation is as follows: the Work Order, a linked document to these Terms, these Terms.
