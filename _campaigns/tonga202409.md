Deploying the first two imaging Seeker AUVs (Athol and Cheryl) on deeper reefs around Tonga.
This marks Cheryl's first taste of salt water, with the parts being shipped separately and final
assembly taking place between deployments of Athol.

This trip also marks the first large scale open water deployments of any Seeker vehicle, with
previous trips being limited to single days testing in Sydney and a very limited field trial in
New Zealand in the lead up to this trip.
