In May 2025, the team spent a week at Norfolk Island  working closely with colleagues from [the Australian Museum](https://australian.museum/) and [the New Zealand Museum](https://aucklandmuseum.com) conducting AUV surveys around Norfolk and Phillip Islands.

This second phase of the Norfolk Island scientific expedition is led by the Australian Museum Research Institute (AMRI) working in collaboration with the University of Sydney, Parks Australia and the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, and the Auckland War Memorial Museum, alongside the local Norfolk Island community. The current expedition to Norfolk Island builds on the terrestrial survey undertaken by AMRI Scientists in 2022-2023.

On this expedition, scientists undertook shore and vessel-based activities to collect fish and marine invertebrates, such as corals, crabs and molluscs, as well as algae, to expand knowledge of the marine environment.  The focus of the AUV surveys was on selected reefs around Norfolk and Phillip Islands.

An overview of the sites visited by the AUV shown in green around Norfolk and Phillip Islands. Each AUV dive covered 1-3km of transect, collecting detailed, high-resolution imagery of the seafloor. The bathymetric map of the seafloor around the islands was collected using LIDAR and acoustic data and was supplied by the Australian Hydrographic Office. AUV dives targeted particular seafloor features representing reefs around the islands at depths from 5-45m of water depth.
