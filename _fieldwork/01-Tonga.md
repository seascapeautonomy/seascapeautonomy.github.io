In October 2024, Jackson and Gideon spent two weeks in Tonga deploying two Seeker AUVs alongside divers on challenging Volcanic reefs.  The aim of this study was to document mesophotic reefs around these rugged, volcanic islands.  The work was funded by the [Inkfish Foundation](https://www.instagram.com/inkfishexpeditions/?hl=en) and included partners from [NTNU Applied Underwater Robotics Lab](https://www.ntnu.edu/web/aur-lab/aur-lab) and the [Reefscape Genomics Lab at the California Academy of Science](https://www.reefscapegenomics.com/).
